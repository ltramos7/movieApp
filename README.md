# movieApp

Welcome to movieApp! This is a simple web application that allows you to search movies by title and learn information about the movie such a director and release data. 

# Purpose

My goal was to showcase some fundamentals of Vanilla JavaScript and Ruby on Rails as the backed.

# movieApp Sample
Feel free to look at this [gif](https://recordit.co/tlrSwm6A59) to see the basic functionallity of **movieApp**. 

# Tech
The backend is using Ruby on Rails with a SQLite database to hold the thumb ratings with its respective movie object. The frontend is built on Vanilla JavaScript and style with CSS. 

# Installation

I built this app on the following versions:
* Ruby 2.6.1
* Rails 6.0.3.4
* Node v14.15.0
* SQLite 3.28.0


Clone the repository into your desired directory. Once the respository has been cloned into your desired directory, follow the steps below.

1. open a terminal and `cd` into `backend`, then run the rails server using `rails s`
2. open a second terminal tab or window and `cd` into `frontend` (make sure you're in the proper directory that holds your `/frontend` directory) 
3. run the command `open index.html` to get the **movieApp** on your browswer

# API Reference

The [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) provied the various endpoints for movie data.

# General Thoughts

This is my first README.md, so any feedback of what should be included for future READMEs would be highly appreciated.

This **movieApp** project was a fun way to learn how to work with external APIs. Writing Vanilla JavaScript allowed me to truly appreciate the React Framework. 

I am excited to refactor my code to make it more DRY, then practice SCSS. After building this project in Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and SCSS, I will then redo the project in React and Bootstrap. 



You can now start using **movieApp** to search for details about movies, as well as to rate using a thumbs up or thumbs down.
